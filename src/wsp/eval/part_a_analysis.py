"""Part A single analysis: registered A5.3/A5.5 outputs and the F10.5 sensitivity reports.

CPU/numpy only. Reads only the files it is given (plus the committed, outcome-free registration
metadata named below). Implements, without tuning:

* the **registered** Part A analysis (PREREG_H1_TF A5.3, A5.3.1, A5.3.2; F10.3 set; F10.9 flags):
  per-pair paired block-bootstrap resolution (32 two-window blocks, 4,000 draws, linear .025/.975
  percentiles; resolved = interval strictly excludes zero), sign agreement (a zero prediction
  disagrees), exact CP 95 % intervals, the per-selected-id ledger, and the A5.5.1 ordered decision,
  evaluated once and **validity first**: step 1 (every external A5.5.1 checklist predicate with
  its linked evidence, the internal pins, the F10.6 calibration state and the A5.4.2 validity of
  the supplied Part B family) is decided before any contrast is read; an unresolved step 1 leaves
  every later step unresolved; then the step-2 ladder alternative, step-3 Part A evidence, step-4
  Part B eligibility and step-5 funding. The supplied Part B results are always reported, on every
  branch, as supplied (never computed or refitted here); the F5.7 null-branch table sits beside it;
* the **F10.5 reports** frozen by ``docs/design/F10_SENSITIVITY_SPEC.md`` (adopted by the F10b
  note at sha256 ``8624e063…98d4``): §1 covariate models M0/M1, §2 norm and ln ρ tertiles, §3 the
  S30/S34 subsets, §4 the constant-sign comparator, §5 the verbatim limitations paragraph, §6
  denominators/units/methods. Every F10.5 output carries ``authority: none (descriptive)`` and
  lives under its own key, apart from the registered decision; none enters step 1.

Fail-closed provenance (Board A, Part A analysis review of 11 Nov 2026, conditions 1–5): before any
output, the specification bytes are hashed and must equal the hash recorded in the F10b.1 adoption
note of ``docs/PREREG_H1_TF.md``, this module's constant and (CLI) the required ``--spec-sha256``;
``text_groups.json`` must have its A5.1.2 sha256, and the ledger must carry exactly its 64 window
item ids in registered order, its 32 two-window blocks and its per-window token-id hashes; every
selected pair needs a complete re-stage audit entry bound to a hashed re-stage report, otherwise
its rotation pair is excluded as ``audit_missing``; if the re-stage yield is below full yield a
hashed slot-masked calibration report (F10.6) is required, its gates and verdict are disclosed and
its embedded NULL-SIZE row is added to the F5.7 table without replacing a row.

Two manifests (Board A re-review condition 2: bind trusted input evidence)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The **frozen staged manifest** is the preserved a533 staging manifest
  ``docs/prereg/a5_manifests/part_a/manifest_a533.json`` (sha256
  :data:`FROZEN_STAGED_MANIFEST_SHA256`, verified at load). The norm tertiles, the ln ρ cut keys
  and cells, the staged ln ρ values and the S30 recomputation are anchored there and never in a
  regenerated manifest (spec §§1.1, 2.2, 3.1; F10b.2 item 3: "frozen from the staged manifest; any
  pair whose re-stage value would cross a cut is flagged, never moved"). Its forty selections are
  the registered ids (sorted-id sha256 :data:`REGISTERED_EDIT_IDS_SHA256`).
* The **execution manifest** is the manifest whose variants were scored (F10 re-stage report,
  later regenerations). It is passed explicitly (CLI ``--manifest`` with the required
  ``--manifest-sha256``); the file bytes must hash to the supplied value, and the sealed ledger's
  ``manifest_sha256`` and ``restage_provenance.manifest_sha256`` must record the same hash. The
  F10 verdicts and reason codes (``edit_audits[i].pair_verdict`` / ``.exclusions``), the F10.4
  pooled ρ (``edit_audits[i].edit_audit.pooled_energy_ratio``, used for the covariate model and for
  ``cell_drift``), the ladder exclusion flags, the selection rows and the variant ids are read
  from it; the ledger's re-stage entries must agree with it (a disagreement refuses the run). The
  run is refused unless every registered id and every a533 variant id is in it, and unless every
  registered selection row equals its frozen row. A selection that is not registered must carry
  ``supplementary: true`` (F11 supplementary edits). A supplementary edit must be a root
  (predecessor ``base``) in an F11.2 depleted cell whose stated tertile recomputes from the frozen
  A5.3.1 norm cut keys (:data:`NORM_CUT_KEYS`; selection.json, bound by the a533 manifest).

F11 (A5 amendment F11, note F11a; Board A Part A analysis review 3, corrections 1–4)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Registered Part A** (F11.5): every selected edit — the forty and the supplements — with
  per-contrast denominators (52 less exclusions, no borrowing) and the ordered decision.
* **F10.5 reports on the supplemented set**: supplements join the covariate models, every sign
  table, the constant-sign comparator and the tertile reports. The forty's frozen cells are
  unchanged; a supplement joins the norm tertile its frozen cut keys give and the ln ρ cell the
  frozen §2.2 cut keys give for its own staged ln ρ (choice 7 below), marked ``supplementary``,
  never moving a frozen member. S30/S34 stay the registered-40 lists; each supplement's values of
  the two subset predicates are shown beside them and never enter them.
* **Registered-40 sensitivity** (``registered_40_sensitivity``): the same contrasts and A5.5
  decision on the forty alone (31 rotation / 40 per ladder strength available under F10),
  labelled descriptive with no decision authority; no supplement enters it. Every contrast is also
  split into roots versus non-root chain steps per family and into the forty versus supplements.
* **Calibration masks per contrast** (F11.4): the supplemented calibration run is required for
  any supplemented analysis; its masks are verified per contrast against the execution manifest
  (rotation exclusions of any id; ladder exclusions of a supplementary id); a ladder exclusion of
  a registered id is refused.
* **Route** (F11.7, F11a.1): size first — a size failure refuses with "hold: size failure requires
  a new amendment"; a power-only failure of the supplemented run selects the screen route
  (rotation contrast not decisive, A5.5 validity row worded as F11.7 states, no Part A go, no G7
  contribution, no Part B funding; ladder alternative priority and the ≥ 15 floor kept), subject
  to Board A's linked acceptance (choice 8); a forty-only F10.6 power failure leaves step 1
  unresolved as before.

The paired-block helpers, the resolution draws and the CP intervals are reused from
``scripts/a5_simulation.py`` (``donor_block``, ``resolution``, ``cp_interval``).

Choices pending adopting note
-----------------------------
The following implementation choices are this code's, not registered text. Each is a **choice
pending adopting note** (a dated A5 note must adopt it, or replace it, before scoring):

1. *Sealed-ledger format* (schema ``a5-part-a-sealed-ledger-v2``: the v1 layout accepted by Board A,
   extended by the condition-3 bindings)::

       {"schema": ..., "sealed": true,
        "manifest_sha256": <execution manifest sha256>, "fields_sha256": <fields file sha256>,
        "text_groups_sha256": <text_groups.json sha256>,
        "window_ids": ["0", ..., "63"] (text_groups.json windows[].item_id, registered order),
        "two_window_blocks": [[0, 1], ..., [62, 63]] (text_groups.json two_window_blocks),
        "window_token_ids_hashes": [64 token_ids_hash values, aligned with window_ids],
        "restage_provenance": {"manifest_sha256": <execution manifest sha256>,
                               "audit_file_sha256": h, "readme_sha256": h},
        "references": {<edit id (original W+D) | predecessor id | "base">: {"mean_nll": [64]}},
        "variants": {<edit id>: {"rotation" | "ladder_0.25" | "ladder_0.5":
                     {"variant_id": ..., "mean_nll": [64] (absent if not scored),
                      "excluded": bool, "exclusions": [codes]}}},
        "restage": {<edit id>: {"f10_3_verdict": "pass" | "excluded",
                    "pre_audit_exclusions": [codes], "f10_3_exclusions": [codes],
                    "registered_realised_verdict": bool, "diagnostics": {F10.4 per-edit values},
                    "variant_json_sha256": h, "pooled_rho": float | null,
                    "tensors": {<name>: {"shape": [...], "logged_d": {5 moments}, "logged_r": {...}}}}}}

   ``mean_nll`` holds TF-v1 WikiText ``extra.mean_nll`` per window (nats per valid next token),
   ``null`` where missing; :func:`window_nll_from_records` builds it from a ``records.jsonl``.
   A re-stage entry that is absent, partial, malformed or lacks a verdict, or a ledger without
   complete ``restage_provenance``, excludes the rotation pair as ``audit_missing`` (F10.3: "A
   missing audit fails closed"); a contradictory entry (verdict vs reason codes) or an unknown
   reason code refuses the analysis. Missing covariates (``pooled_rho`` null, absent moments) are
   not audit failures: they drop the row from both covariate models only (spec §1.4).
   Fields JSON maps each selected edit id to three predictions in [rotation, ladder .25, ladder .5]
   order (A5.3.2 convention), optionally wrapped as ``{"predictions": {...}}``.
2. *Resolution seed and draws*: one index array from
   ``numpy.random.Generator(numpy.random.PCG64(20261107))`` (``sim.resolution``) shared by every
   pair, arm and contrast (common draws); resampling the paired difference column.
3. *Solver tie-break*: Newton–Raphson with step halving, where a step whose objective is flat
   within floating-point resolution (|Δf| ≤ 8·eps·|f|) is accepted only if it reduces max
   |gradient| (:func:`fit_ridge_logistic`); a numerical refinement, not an alternative model.
4. *Validity input* (``--validity``): ``{<predicate>: {"pass": bool, "evidence": [{"path": str,
   "sha256": <64 hex>}, ...]}}`` for every name in :data:`VALIDITY_PREDICATES`. A predicate
   certifies step 1 only with ``pass: true`` and a non-empty, well-formed evidence list that links
   the required pins (:func:`validity_bindings`): ``registration_pinned`` the specification,
   frozen staged (a533) manifest, text groups, fields and NULL-SIZE report hashes;
   ``selection_and_audits`` the three re-stage provenance hashes (whose manifest hash is the
   execution manifest's); ``null_size`` the NULL-SIZE report and, when F10.6 applies,
   the slot-masked calibration report hash. ``g2_predecessor_audit`` with ``pass: false`` carries
   the registered hard stop of G2 pending a new amendment.
5. *Part B input* (``--part-b``; produced by the Part B pipeline, not computed here):
   ``{"points": {C, C_abl, C_rand, C_perm}, "intervals": {name: {"conditional": [lo, hi],
   "joint": [lo, hi]}}, "valid": {name: bool}, "diagnostics": {name: {procedure: {"draws": 4000,
   "failed_draws": 0, "min_distinct_components": ≥ 2}}}, "destruction_controls_eligible": bool,
   "evidence": [{path, sha256}], "power_at_0_15": {"conditional": p, "joint": p} (optional)}``.
   Missing Part B, a false ``valid`` flag, a missing/nonfinite/reversed/malformed point or
   interval, failed or missing draws, fewer than two distinct components or ineligible destruction
   controls fail step 1 (A5.5.1: "Invalid/undefined statistics, including A5.4.2 failures, enter
   validity first"; checklist rows 8–9). A present but nonfinite or out-of-range power value is
   malformed; absent power only blocks the no-go branch.
6. *F10.6 calibration input* (``--masked-calibration``): the JSON output of
   ``scripts/a5_simulation.py --slot-mask`` (``slot_mask`` with label, mask file sha256, canonical
   mapping sha256, masked ids and gates; ``reports.null_size``). Its masked rotation ids must
   equal the re-stage exclusions and its canonical mapping sha256 must recompute from them.
   Required (else refusal) when the re-stage yield is below full yield; refused at full yield,
   where the registered F2/F7 simulations stand without a new run. A failed gate makes step 1
   unresolved (F10.6: "A failure makes Part A not decisive"). With supplementary edits the
   ``--supplement`` output (F11.4) is always required: label "slot-masked (F10.6); supplemented
   (F11.4)", a ``supplement`` block binding the supplementary ids' sorted-id sha256, k and slot
   count, per-contrast ``masked_ids`` and the canonical availability mapping sha256 recomputed
   from the execution manifest, optional ``slots`` table consistent with it, and the gates with
   the ordered power, ordered-go size and three two-sided size rates (needed for the screen
   route, F11a.1(c)). The registered-40 sensitivity run (no decision authority) is refused.
7. *Supplementary cell convention* (F11.5 "F10.5 reports on the supplemented set"; Board A
   correction 1): a supplement's norm tertile is its A5.3.1 cell under :data:`NORM_CUT_KEYS`
   (verified against every a533 row); its ln ρ cell is :data:`LNRHO_CUTS` applied to its staged
   ln ρ = 2·ln(1 + pooled_norm_mismatch) from its own F11.3 staging record (execution manifest),
   the spec §1.1 formula; no staged value → no ln ρ cell (listed). Re-stage ln ρ and
   ``cell_drift`` are shown as for the forty. S30/S34 predicate values come from the same record
   (``pooled_norm_mismatch`` ≤ 2e-2, cross-checked with ``in_subset_pooled_norm_2e-2``;
   ``in_subset_noise_calibrated`` or ``noise_calibrated_passes``).
8. *Screen-route acceptance input* (F11a.1(d)): ``--validity`` may carry
   ``"f11a_screen_route": {"pass": true, "evidence": [{path, sha256}, ...]}``; on a power-only
   failure its evidence must link the calibration report's sha256, else step 1 is unresolved.

LIMITATIONS = (
    "**Limitations of the Part A rotation contrast and its F10.5 sensitivities.** (1) "
    "*Quantisation.* The scored rotation is R_eff = bf16(W + R) − W = R + E_R, a second bf16 "
    "rounding at the predecessor grid of the same size as the edit's own rounding (median "
    "ε_R/ε_D 1.0003 over 2,188 root-edit tensors; staged pooled realised norm mismatch "
    "+0.0007 to +0.0309; pooled ε_R up to 0.365, largest in the low norm tertile; "
    "`docs/design/ROTATION_YIELD_2026-11-11.md` §§1.2, 1.4). Its first-order part ⟨g, E_R⟩ is"
    " inside the registered prediction ⟨g, D_eff − R_eff⟩. The realised extra energy is not "
    "removed by design, and the exclusion rule (F10.3) does not test realised rotation "
    "quality. (2) *Curvature.* The second-order effect of that energy is not priced by the "
    "registered prediction. The F9 quadratic forecast's q is a nonnegative Gauss–Newton "
    "magnitude only, never a signed Hessian correction (A5.8.1; F9a.2(c)), and for the chain "
    "picks it uses base K-FAC factors (F6.2, `base-factor`). The constant-sign nuisance "
    "argument of the design note §2.3 is a plausible mechanism under positive, roughly "
    "isotropic curvature, not a theorem for every pair; fresh rounding depends on W and R and"
    " can correlate with the field or the prediction signs (Board A F10). (3) *Sign "
    "imbalance.* The registered power inputs carry rotation prediction signs 43 positive and "
    "98 negative of 141 donors "
    "(`docs/prereg/a5_manifests/power/fields_manifest.json:summary.sign_distribution.rotation`)."
    " Negative is the direction in which the energy nuisance pushes d_i, so a constant-sign "
    "nuisance can raise agreement when predictions are imbalanced towards negative. The "
    "report's predicted-sign split shows the actual balance. (4) *No realised spectrum "
    'matching.* "Spectrum-matched" refers to the pre-rounding construction only. No realised '
    "norm, spectrum or rank match is claimed (F10.4; A5.3.3), and passing the F10.3 audit is "
    "not evidence of one. (5) *Chain ladders.* For the 8 non-root chain picks, the 16 ladder "
    "variants scale the realised increment D_t, not the unavailable raw step Δ_t "
    "(`realised-increment ladder`, F10.9). Equivalence to the registered raw-step ladder is "
    "not established: the 0.066–0.392 noise-floor ratio is a heuristic scale, not a measured "
    "error or an upper bound (Board A F10, F10.9 ruling). (6) *Null branch frequency.* Under "
    "the registered NULL-SIZE proxy the ordered decision returns the funding-only "
    "**alternative** branch in 1,939 of 10,000 null replicates (rate 0.1939, exact CP 95 % "
    "[0.18619, 0.20179]), against ordered go 180/10,000 (0.018) "
    "(`docs/prereg/a5_manifests/nullsize/report.json`; F5.7). An alternative outcome is a "
    "funding stop for the field, never evidence of wrong signs. (7) *Proxy and dependence "
    "(F7).* The NULL-SIZE and POWER-AND-YIELD results (ordered power 0.8540) are conditional "
    "on F2's edit-minus-actual-predecessor noise surrogate, the |donor mean| effect scale and"
    " the 0.75 sign-agreement alternative. They are not empirical rotation-null or power "
    "certification. The single LoRA low-tertile donor is reused for all ten slots of that "
    "cell. The three contrasts rescale one donor block and under the null are one test, not "
    "three. Simulated yield 1.0 rests on treating 423 unavailable audit entries as passes, "
    "and the `unavailable_audit_fails` scenario resolves no pair (Board A F7 conditions 2–4)."
    " (8) *Scope.* The claim is agreement above chance conditional on the frozen field, the "
    "fixed 64-window panel and resolution, on development edits whose D3 outcomes were "
    'already known (A5.3 "Exposure"). It is not an item-population claim. Covariate '
    "adjustment, tertile and subset reports are descriptive: they neither certify an unbiased"
    " primary contrast nor validate its null, and none can change A5.5's outcome."
